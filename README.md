# Pharmaceutical-Chatbot-using-machine-learning
A chatbot is a software application used to conduct an on-line chat conversation via text or text-to-speech, in lieu of providing direct contact with a live human agent.

Chatbots are becoming more and more popular in many industries, including the pharmaceutical and medical industry. Their ability to mimic human conversations through text and auditory means can prove beneficial to the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry.

Chatbots are used a lot in customer interaction, marketing on social network sites and instantly messaging the client. They can make life easier for patients, doctors and employees alike.

For example, patients can be supported before and after treatment. Doctors can find out quickly and at any time of the day about the interactions or other properties of drugs, and sales staff can prepare for customer meetings with the help of a bot.
